# Pacman Game Project ðŸ‘¾

## Overview
This project is a recreation of the classic Pacman arcade game built using OpenFrameworks in C++. The game features the iconic maze navigation, pellet collection, ghost avoidance, and power-up mechanics that made the original game a timeless classic.

## About the Project
This implementation uses the OpenFrameworks C++ toolkit to handle graphics rendering, input detection, and game physics. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts including inheritance, encapsulation, and game state management.

## Features
- Classic Pacman maze navigation
- Ghost AI with different behavior patterns
- Pellet and power pellet collection
- Score tracking system
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty

## Technologies Used
- C++ programming language
- OpenFrameworks toolkit
- Object-oriented design principles

## Installation and Setup
1. Ensure you have OpenFrameworks installed. If not, download it from [openframeworks.cc](https://openframeworks.cc/download/)
2. Clone this repository to your local machine
3. Place the project folder in your OpenFrameworks `apps/myApps/` directory
5. Use the command
```
make Release
```

## How to Play
- Use arrow keys or WASD to navigate Pacman through the maze
- Collect all pellets while avoiding ghosts
- Eat power pellets to temporarily hunt ghosts
- Complete all levels to win the game
